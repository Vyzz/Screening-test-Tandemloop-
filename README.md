## üß† Design Process

1. **Analysis**
   - Carefully studied the three desktop section screenshots provided.
   - Identified all reusable components: badges, headings, cards, KPIs, feature blocks, and buttons.

2. **Mobile Adaptation**
   - Recreated each section at a mobile screen width of **375px**.
   - Optimized text hierarchy for small screens using appropriate font sizes and spacing.
   - Maintained brand and visual consistency.

3. **Typography and Icons**
   - Used **Manrope** font throughout for a clean and modern appearance.
   - Kept all icons from the desktop version to maintain familiarity and visual clarity on mobile.

4. **Spacing System**
   - Followed an 8pt spacing system for consistency across paddings, margins, and grid gaps.
   - Used generous padding on cards and buttons to ensure touch accessibility.

5. **Visual Balance**
   - Adjusted alignments and layout stacking to accommodate single-column flow.
   - Avoided visual clutter while maintaining clarity of content.
